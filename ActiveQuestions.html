    <li> Create Post <!-- self-explanatory; this will include a variety of questions and options for the eventual output --> </li>
    <li> Search <!-- self-explanatory; I'm still deciding exactly how I want to do tags/subreddit equivalents --> </li>
    <li> Save/Track <!-- given the active nature of the tool, and the reference-utility of the results, it'll be important for users to easily track ongoing questions --> </li>
