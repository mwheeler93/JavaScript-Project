  Here's a landing-page description about the utility of the site, hopefully with some bright colors and good graphics
  Also, some highlights/trends for the site (you know, assuming there are users)
  <!-- below are links to the main content areas of the site; like most of the rest of the landing page, these will be displayed with descriptions in a far more aesthetic way than they are currently -->
  <a href="ActiveQuestions.html"> ActiveQuestions </a>
  <a href="ArchiveDirectory.html"> Archive/Directory </a>
