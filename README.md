# JavaScript-Project
First Project with JavaScript

Hey David,

This README is currently just for you.

Here's my idea: forum specifically for crowdsourced learning. That is, a user can post a question about something they want to learn (not as much a detail or an answer as much as a skill) and a particular timeframe in which they wish to learn it and a maximum cost; the post will become publicly visible, at which point other users can reply with their ideas (particularly resources like courses, websites, books, etc.). Like most many forums, there will be upvote/downvote systems for comments. I'm still deciding on how exactly the life of a post will be terminated (upon reaching a particular goal determined by the user, number of replies, time open, etc.). I hope that gives a good sense, but let me know if there are clear gaps in that explanation.

Reasons I chose this project include:
1. It doesn't require finding or entering data (as many of my other projects did)
2. There is a clear use for user profiles and tracking of user information over time
3. I'll be able to create some detailed search functions
4. There's a lot of room to play with the interface

You'll find a file with a series of drawing depicting the general design of the main pages in the repository. What you won't find described yet is the user profile page/saved data interface. That will be included once I move from page design and built-in functions to user-specific content.

Thanks for taking the time to review this! I really appreciate it.

My next steps are to begin creating some of the functions I've described, and to bring the site to some degree of its (eventually) interactive life. I'll work on user-specifics after that, then interface. Does that make sense? There's a substantial knowledge gap in my understanding of how to utilize databses for a site like this, which is one of the big learning goals I have for the next few weeks.

Sincerely,
-Mike
